# Minards-Map

The project recreates Charles Minard’s Visualization of Napoleon’s March on Mosco. The programming language used is R and the tool used is R studio. Screenshot1.png depicts position of cities and path of army through them. The red line indicates that troops were marching to attack and the green light depicts army’s retrieval back to base camp. The temperature has been scaled according to the troops retreat so that it aids in visualising the data easily.

</br>Initially, I loaded relevant libraries. Ggplot function is used to map data to colour and size. The “round” attribute is added to fix individual segments of the path. Scale_size is used with intension to show size of the army. Screenshot1.png clearly shows that initially size of army was huge and decreases gradually. We can also infer that soldiers died due to extreme weather conditions. Scale_colour_manual is used to give different colours to armies marching towards attack and their retrieval. Geom_text and Geom_point functions are used to add cities on the graph. I have used Geom_text_repel function to avoid overlapping of city labels.
Screenshot2.png shows temperatures during the retreat and the days of the retreat of the army. On the x –axis we have longitude, and temperature (0c) on y-axis. Along with temperature it also displays date. To make the graph I have used gridExtra function.
